MCMC dift approach to efficiency gap (wasted votes: reverse engineered to Kennedy)

MCMC two ways to proceed: adding counties vs splitting existing districts. Same result.

Clerks understand the math

Moon Dutchin (Tufts, Director of Metric Geometry and gerrymendering group) amazingly articulate and intelligent

Not threshold/cutoff of extreme partisanship, but a principle
