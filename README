Code and data to analyze Mexican federal districts used in 2006-2012 elections and the 2013 redistricting proposal. 
This is work in progress.

Download files to disk, then set (towards the start of file analizaEscenarios2013.r) the directory where code and data are stored. 
The said file has code to replicate, in R, the preliminary analysis appearing in ericmagar.wordpress.com/.
